1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, <article>, <aside>, <figure>, <footer>, <header>, 
<main>, <mark>, <nav>, <section>, <summary>, and <time>- Clearly defines its content.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

display: block; means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have 
always been. A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements next
to it, except when ordered otherwise (by adding a float declaration to another element, for instance).
display: inline; means that the element is displayed inline, inside the current block on the 
same line. Only when it's between two blocks does the element form an 'anonymous block', that 
however has the smallest possible width.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

content area, padding area, border area, and margin area.

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?

The align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. In Flexbox, 
it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis, especially when using wrapping.

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Git offers the type of performance, functionality, security, and flexibility that most developers 
and teams need to develop their projects.
Git tracks the changes developers make to files, in any set of files, usually used for coordinating
work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into 
one source.
